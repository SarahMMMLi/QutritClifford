# A Complete and Natural Rule Set for Multi-Qutrit Clifford Circuits

In this repo, we present all proofs of reducing 376 box relations to a much smaller, more canonical set of rewrites rules. In the end, we find that 17 gate relations, as presented in Figure 1 of our paper, suffice to prove these 378 box relations. In what follows we explain the folder structure, notations, and the conventions of all proofs, as well as how they are mapped onto Appendix E of the paper.
